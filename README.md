# Django E-Commerce Online Shop

Welcome to the Django E-Commerce Online Shop project! This project aims to provide a fully-featured online shopping platform built using the Django web framework. With a focus on modularity and extensibility, this project encompasses essential functionalities such as product catalog management, a seamless shopping cart experience, checkout processes, payment integration, invoice generation, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Django E-Commerce Online Shop, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

   git clone https://github.com/Mtumish1/-Django-Online-Tech-Shop.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd django-e-commerce
   ```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

  ``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Apply database migrations:
