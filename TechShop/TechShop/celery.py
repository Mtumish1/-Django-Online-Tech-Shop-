"""In this code, you do the following
You set the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable for the Celery command-line program.
You create an instance of the application with app = Celery('myshop')
You load any custom configuration from your project settings using the
config_from_object() method. The namespace attribute specifies the
prefix that Celery-related settings will have in your settings.py file.
By setting the CELERY namespace, all Celery settings need to include the
CELERY_ prefix in their name (for example, CELERY_BROKER_URL).
• Finally, you tell Celery to auto-discover asynchronous tasks for your
applications. Celery will look for a tasks.py file in each application
directory of applications added to INSTALLED_APPS in order to load
asynchronous tasks defined in it."""
